# Life-Expectancy-Neural-Network

"""
The World Health Organization (WHO)â€™s Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository tracks life expectancy for countries worldwide by following health status and many other related factors.

Although there have been a lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition, and mortality rates, it was found that the effects of immunization and human development index were not taken into account.

This dataset covers a variety of indicators for all countries from 2000 to 2015 including:

    immunization factors
    mortality factors
    economic factors
    social factors
    other health-related factors
